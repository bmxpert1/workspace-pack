# workspace-pack

Create a deployable npm package when using Yarn workspaces

## Details

If you use Yarn's `workspaces` feature to manage a monorepo, but need to "pack" a single package into a deployable zip that resolves both local and remote dependencies, this might be the tool for you.

## Install

```
$ yarn global add @bubuntux/workspace-lambda-pack
```

## Usage

```bash
# In your workspaces root dir
$ workspace-pack my-package-folder
```
